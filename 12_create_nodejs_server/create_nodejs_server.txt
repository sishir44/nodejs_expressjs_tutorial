Web Server:
* To access web pages of any web application, we need  a web server.
* The web server will handle all the HTTP requests for the web application.

Eg: 
    IIS is a web server for ASP.NET,
    Apache is a web server for PHP or Java and so on......

* Nodejs provides capabilities to create your own web server which will handle HTTP requests asynchronously.
* We can use IIS or Apache to run Nodejs web applications but it is recommended to use Nodejs web server.
